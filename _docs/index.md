What is this?
=============

This site is [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and  describes how Product Space works and why. Think of it as our DNA, or, our manifesto.

The way we work and why, is so important to us that we wanted to describe it in detail. In the process, we discovered Crisp, an extraordinary company in Sweden. The content here comes largely from Crisp documenting the way they work. They allow organisatios to clone a copy of their DNA for re-use. And we've done just that. From deep in our hearts, thank you [Crisp](https://www.crisp.se).

We've modified quite a bit to suit our Australian way of doing things, but in essence, we think and act similar to the way Crisp does.

[Product Space](https://www.theproductspace.com) is an agile product management consultancy based in Sydney, Australia. We are a consulting company but importantly, we do consulting differently
For example:

-   Firstly we don't like the word 'consultant' so we call ourselves Members. Having said that, consulting is an obvious description of what we do.
- None of the Members are employed by Product Space.
-   We have no managers, no admin, not even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organisation and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
-   Members are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or [our Home](what-is-productspace.html)), and work as much or as little as they want, for who they want.
-   Product Space's main purpose is to enable Members to be happy and the [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) is our driving metric. Solid revenue and happy clients are a side effect, not a goal.
-   Product Space doesn't earn money from its Members. It is in practice, a non-profit company (although not formally so). Members [keep most of what they earn](economic-model.html). Gold in, gold out for those that work at Product Space.
-   Our [ownership model](ownership-model.html) is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in". The company isn't worth anything, financially speaking. 


People are intrigued when we talk about this and are curious as to how it works in practice, especially from other people looking to create something similar. 

Between what we've learned from Crisp and our amazing mates at Nomad8 in New Zealand, we've converged on a model that works well for us. And that's basically the sweet spot between being an independent consultant and being an employee.

Why open-source the Product Space DNA?
------------------------------

-   To make the world a better place :) The model has helped us be happy and make a positive impact in the world, and publishing it may help others do the same.
-   Open-sourcing it is a fun social experiment, we're curious about what's going to happen :)
- Open-sourcing suits our values around sharing and power. It makes us happy to share this.
-   By making our model public, we're more likely to keep it up-to-date and improve it as we learn.
-   Putting it on GitHub makes it easier for others to clone and evolve the model, and in turn, we can learn from them.

Driving principles
------------------

These principles drive almost everything at Product Space:

-   [What is Product Space](what-is-productspace.html) - the purpose of the company.
-   [How Product Space works](how-productspace-works.html) - summary of our model, and some driving principles.
-   [Why this works](why-this-works.html) - why this model serves us so well.

Core structure and practices
----------------------------

Although these are core to our model, they are mostly just consequences of the principles above:

-   [Board of directors](board-of-directors.html) - Australian law requires that we have a Board of Directors; here's how it works.
-   [Bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) - how we handle client enquiries and route to the right Member.
-   [Communication](communication-meetings-tools.html) - how we collaborate, sync, and improve.
-   [Dashboard](dashboard.html) - how we see the big picture.
-   [Economic model](economic-model.html) - how  money flows through the system.
-   [Happiness index](happiness-index.html) - how we know if we are succeeding.
-   [How we make decisions](decisions.html) - how  decisions get made when there is no manager or CEO.
-   [Our business](our-business.html) - what type of work we do.
-   [Ownership model](ownership-model.html) - how  people become owners, and what ownership actually means.
-   [Recruiting](recruiting-and-onboarding.html) - how new people get in.
-   [Sales](sales.html) - how we sell Members.
-   [Vision](visions.html) - how you get a bunch of autonomous people aligned.
-   [Unconference](unconference.html) - how our bi-annual unconference works.

Supporting practices
--------------------

This is relevant stuff, but not core to our model.

-   [Agreements](contracts.html) - legal agreements for Product Space membership, ownership, etc.
-   [Building competence](building-competence.html) - how we learn from each other and improve.
-   [Brand building](brand-building.html) - how we build the brands, both Product Space and personal brands.
-   [Conflict handling](conflict-handling.html) - how we make sure conflicts are constructive rather than destructive.
-   [Courses](courses-development.html) - how courses get produced and delivered.
-   [Industries that we avoid](industries-that-we-avoid.html) - why we avoid certain industries.
