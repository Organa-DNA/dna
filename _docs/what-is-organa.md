What is Organa and why?
======================

Our purpose is simple: to enable our Members to be happy. We measure only one thing and that's their happiness. 

We've visualised "Our home" below, along with a description of other things that are important to us.

We bring it to our gatherings and meetups to remind us of who we are and why, and also in case we want to update it.  

## What we do

We are an agile and product consulting business. We coach with and consult to individuals, teams and leaders in product management and new ways of working. We love seeing human potential unleashed and valuable products created for customers when you work with a team to craft new approaches to the work they do.

In simple terms, we are a consultancy. But a consultancy done differently. Very differently. 


## What we value

Organa is a home for advisers (Members) who value:

- Freedom and autonomy in return for transparency and accountability.
- Hearts over wallets.
- We care for the community over individual pursuits.
- Continuous learning over 100% billable work.

We reckon these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent adviser (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).


> If you [clone the Organa model](how-to-copy.html), you don't have to have the same values. You may have ones that are special to you so use them. Our model derives from our core values which are close to those shared by Crisp so the closer your values are to ours or Crips's, the better the model will fit your context.
