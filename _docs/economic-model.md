Economic Model
==============

Our high level economic model is summarised in [How Product Space Works](how-Product-Space-works.html) so listed here are some examples of how our economic model works.

Example: One month
------------------

Suppose Sandy is a Product Space Member, and her current client is HappyClient1. Sandy's consulting fee is $150 per hour. And suppose the current Product Space fee is 10% of Sandy's billables + $200/month.

1.  During January, Sandy does 100 hours of work for HappyClient1.
2.  At the end of January, she adds one row to the invoicing spreadsheet (a single shared Google doc), noting that HappyClient1 should be invoiced $10,000 for January.
3.  The office team sends a $10,000 invoice from Product Space to HappyClient1, for Sandy's services.
4.  Sandy sends a $9,000 invoice from her personal company to Product Space ($10,000 minus the 10% Product Space "members fee").

**Result for January:**
HappyClient1 pays $10,000, Sandy earns $9,000, Product Space earns $1,000.

In addition, once per quarter Product Space sends a $600 invoice to Sandy's company (3 x $200, the monthly fixed fee).

So let's put it all together.

Example: One year
-----------------

Suppose Sandy earns the same amount as above, every month for a year. In that case the net result is:

-   HappyClient1 paid $120,000 for Sandy's services ($10,000 x 12 months).
-   Sandy earned $108,000 for her work at HappyClient1 (90% of the income from HappyClient1).
-   Product Space earned $12,000 from Sandy's work at HappyClient1 (10% of the income from HappyClient1).
-   In addition, Sandy paid $2,400 to Product Space in fixed fees ($200 x 12 months).
-   **Result for the year:**
    -   HappyClient1: -$120,000
    -   Sandy: +$102,000
    -   Product Space: +$14,400.

Example: hitting the ceiling
----------------------------

Suppose the Product Space fee ceiling is $15,000 per year. 

And suppose Sandy gets famous for her specialty skills in reinventing organisations, and manages to land a $200/hour gig at Company Y. Sandy still works 100 hours per month (reserving the rest of her time for hobby projects, fun and family).

That means Sandy will earn in about $240,000, which means the Product Space fee would be $24,000. That's way past the $15,000 ceiling, and we haven't even taken the fixed $200/month into account. The point of having a ceiling is to make sure the cost of being at Product Space doesn't get out of hand for the highest paid consultants.

Sandy shares in Slack that she's most likely going to hit the ceiling this year, so there's no point bothering with the % fee. Instead, Sandy keeps 100% of what she earns, and Product Space just invoices her the ceiling fee of $3750 per quarter ($15,000 per year / 4 quarters). Simple.

If she turns out to be wrong (because Company Y cancels her engagement) then they'll go back and recalculate. No big deal, it's just an internal calculation that clients don't see.

Example: adjusting the fees
---------------------------

At the end of the financial year, the [board](board-of-directors.html) notices that Product Space is accumulating too much money (remember we maintain a limited liquidity buffer and try not build up piles of cash), so they lower the fee to 9% + $200/month, and lower the ceiling to $18,000/year. Yay!

Check [how Product Space works](how-productspace-works.html) if you are curious about why we don't want Product Space to earn a big profit.

What about taxes and GST?
-------------------------

Taxes and GST? Yes, that messes up the clean calculations above.

We have experts hired to deal with that, and much of that is country-specific, so we won't bore you with details. Suffice to say, once you pass the GST threshold of $75,000 in Australia, you start allowing for GST. 

What about risk pooling? What if someone gets in financial trouble?
-------------------------------------------------

What if a Member can't find a client for an extended period? Or what if a client suddenly goes bankrupt and doesn't pay? What if a consultant gets seriously sick?

In a "normal" consulting company, Members get their salary every month and the employer needs to prepare for risks using things like cash buffers and insurances. But Product Space is more like a bunch of collaborating independents, and we leave it up to each individual to manage risk and insurance in their own company.

Nevertheless it may sound obvious that Product Space should provide a "rainy day insurance" for each Member, a shared cash buffer to support a Member who runs into sudden cash flow problems. But that money needs to come from somewhere, and will in one way or another cause the Product Space fee to increase.

Different people have different risk profiles. Some are very careful, keep their expenses low, and buffer lots of cash for rainy days. Some are less careful, spend most of what they earn, and get involved in risky projects that may or may not pay off. Also, some people are good at managing their money, while others are sloppier. Remember freedom and autonomy are high on the list of what we value.

As a result, our discussions always end up with people divided into two camps:

-   **Yes**: "An insurance will increase my freedom and security, because Product Space will help me if I run into temporary cash flow problems."
-   **No**: "An insurance will decrease my freedom and security, because of the increased fees. I manage risk fine today by saving cash and minimising unnecessary expenses."

This is where our [explicitly stated core values](what-is-producspace.html) come into use. Freedom is a core value, financial stability isn't. That doesn't mean financial stability isn't important, it just means that people came to Product Space primarily for freedom, and that includes the freedom to choose your own risk-management approach.

Ther reasoning always leads us to the same conclusion:

-   **Compromise**: "Some people want a shared insurance, some don't. Therefore we won't force it upon everyone. Instead, those individuals who want an insurance (and are willing to pay for it) can get together and form one together. That way, insurance is opt-in."

So anyone who wants to do risk-pooling is free to propose a model and see if anyone wants to join, but insurance isn't owned or managed by Product Space. 

Interestingly enough, no such generic insurance has been created yet, because nobody has managed to define a model that is good enough to attract a critical mass of participants.

THis is a tempoarary change.
