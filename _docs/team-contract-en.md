Team Member Services Agreement
===================

Each Member runs their own company or sole trader (the language in Australia), and each Member provides services to Organa. That includes Sarah and Sandy the curret owners of the business.

That means that each of us commits to the same Services Agreement and the same conditions.

We've put quite a bit of effort into writing our legal agreements in Plain English, for one main reason: **trust**. 

We believe:

- People are systematically and fundamentally good and will do the right thing.
-  As partners, collaborators, guides, coaches and mentors, trust is our default means of engagement. 

 You've all read legal agreements that go on for pages and pages, where you have to keep looking up the Definitions in order to understand the damn thing. 
 
 Well that shits people like us, so we first briefed our good mate Mark who's a savvy lawyer on who we are and why we operate the way we do. He then wrote a draft Agreement that covered the legal requirements but was written with our values and purpose in mind. He did a great job on guiding us through where in the Agreement we could relax, what we could rewrite and remove. 
 
 We gave that copy to Lynne our good mate who specialises in Plain English writing but has a legal background and asked her to finesse it.
 
 The result ... an Agreement we actually enjoy reading. Ok, that's a stretch, but it's an  Agreement that Members can understand quickly and don't need to get legal advice on

 The result. An Agreement that's easy to read, easy to understand and straight-forward to commit to.

 For those in Australia and possibly New Zealand, if it makes sense to do so, [help yourself to a copy](contracts.html) and use it for your own work.
 
 "Thank you". 
 
 "You're weclome, it's our pleasure :)"
