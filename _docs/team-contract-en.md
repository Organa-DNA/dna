Team Member Services Agreement
===================

Each Member runs their own company or sole trader (the language in Australia), and each Member provides services to Product Space. That includes Sarah and Sandy the owners of the business.

That means that each of us commits to the same Services Agreement and the same conditions.

We've put quite a bit of effort into rewriting our legal agreements into Plain English and dramatically shortening them, for one main reason: **trust**. 

We believe:

- People are systematically and fundamentally good and will do the right thing.
-  As partners, collaborators, guides, coaches and mentors, trust is our default means of engagement. 

 You've all read legal agreements that go on for pages and pages, where you have to keep looking up the Definitions in order to understand the damn thing. 
 
 Well that shits people like us, so we got our good mate Mark who's a savvy lawyer to give us all the stuff we should have in a Services Agreement. One of us had a series of conversation with Mark who rather than being an anal retentive arse-covering risk averse lawyer, thought about the business and operational context and gave us awesome advice on where in the agreement we could relax, rewrite or remove. 
 
 We gave that copy to Lynne our good mate who specialises in Plain English writing but has a legal background and asked her to edit it giving consideration to our values and how we wish to operate.
 
 The result. An Agreement that's easy to read, easy to understand. An Agreement that's straight-forward to commit to.

 For those in Australia and possibly New Zealand, if it makes sense to do so, [help yourself to a copy](contracts.html) and use it for your own work. It's our pleasure.
