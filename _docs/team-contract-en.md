Product Space Member Services Agreement
===================

Each Member runs their own company or sole trader (the language in Australia), and each Member provides services to Product Space. That includes Sarah and Sandy the owners of the business.

That means that each of us commits to the same Services Agreement and the same conditions.

We put quite a bit of effort into rewriting our legal agreements into Plain English and dramatically shortening them, for one main reason: **trust**. 

We believe:

- People are systematically and fundamentally good and will do the right thing.
-  As partners, collaborators, guides, coaches and mentors, trust is our default means of engagement. 

 You've all read those Agreements that go on for pages and pages, where you have to keep looking up the Definitions in order to understand the damn thing. Well we hate that so we got our good mate Mark who's a savvy lawyer to give us all the stuff we should have in a Services Agreement. One of us had a solid conversation with Mark who rather than being an anal retentive arse covering lawyer, thought about the business and operational context and gave us advice as to what we could relax with and remove. 
 
 We gave that copy to Lynne our good mate who specialises in Plain English writing but has a legal background and asked her to rewrite it giving consideration to our values and how we wish to operate.
 
 The result ... an Agreement I actually enjoyed reading. 

 For those in Australia and possibly New Zealand, take a copy and use it for your own work. It's our pleasure.
