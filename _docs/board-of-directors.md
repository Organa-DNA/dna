Board of directors
==================

Being an Australian company, we're required to have a board of directors. In most companies, the board is appointed by the owners to represent them so that the management group, headed by the CEO, runs the company according to the directives from the owners and the board.

At Product Space, this works differently. 

First of all, we have no CEO and no management layers. Second, [we invite all Product Space Members to become owners after 2 years](ownership-model.html, and third, we hold a yearly election of the board members where all Product Space members (owners or not) have the right to vote. 

Since [we have no CEO role](decisions.html), and since we have autonomous consultants, there is little to manage.

What does the board do?
-----------------------

The board has quarterly meetings. The most important responsibilities are to ensure the financial management and health of Product Space is OK and that Product Space members are happy. The meetings are open for any Product Space members to attend and observe if they wish.

Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity to be able to do day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end of the fiscal year. See [Economic Model](economic-model.html) for details.

If there are any Product Space members with a low score on [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html), a board members takes it upon themselves to connect with that person to work with them on what can be done to make the member happier.

This is the template for our monthly board meetings.
