Board of directors
==================

Being an Australian company, we are required to have a board of directors. In most companies, the board is appointed by the owners to represent them so that the management group, headed by the CEO, runs the company according to the directives from the owners and the board.

At Product Space, this works a little differently. First of all, [we invite all Product Space Members to become owners after 2 years](ownership-model.html), and second, we hold a yearly election of the board members where all Product Space members (owners or not) have the right to vote. Since [we have gotten rid of the CEO role](decisions.html), and since we have very autonomous consultants, there is really quite little to manage.

What does the board do?
-----------------------

The board have monthly board meetings. The most important responsibilities are to make sure the financial aspect of Product Space is OK and that the Product Space members are happy. The meetings are open for any Product Space members to attend if they wish.

Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity to be able to do day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end of the fiscal year. See [Economic Model](economic-model.html) for details.

If there is any Product Space members with a low score on [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html), a board members takes it upon themselves to call that person and to try and find out what can be done to make the member happier.

This is the template for our monthly board meetings.
