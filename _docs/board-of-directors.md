Board of directors
==================

Being an Australian company, we're required to have a board of directors. In most companies, the board is appointed by the owners to represent them so that the management group, headed by the CEO, runs the company according to the directives from the board.

At Organa, this works differently. 

First of all, we have no CEO and no management. Second, we invite all Organa Members to become [owners after 2 years](ownership-model.html). 

Since [we have no CEO role](decisions.html), and since we have autonomous Members, there is little to manage.

What does the Board do?
-----------------------

The board comes together twice a year. The most important responsibilities are to ensure the financial management and health of Organa is OK and that Organa Members are happy. The meetings are open for any Organa Members to attend and observe if they wish.

Managing the finances involves keeping an eye on the liquidity in order to manage the day-to-day business and to aim for a zero result at the end of the financial year. See [Economic Model](economic-model.html).

If there are any Organa Members with a low score on [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html), a board member takes it upon themselves to connect with that person to work with them on what can be done to make the Member happier. This has not happened yet.

This is the template for our quarterly board meetings.
