Product Space Happy Member Dashboard
===============

The happy Member dashboard is an internal shared google spreadsheet containing our most vital shared information. 

It starts with the [happiness index](happiness-index.html), and include other tabs like:

-   **Happiness index** - how happy are we and why?
-   **Happiness history** - how has the happiness index developed over time?
-   **Capacity & availability** - who needs a new client?
-   **Competency matrix** - who is good at what, and who is interested in what?
-   **Decision log** - which Product Space-wide decisions have been made?

Who is responsible for keeping it up to date?
---------------------------------------------

We are currently sharing the responsibility of keeping the dashboard updated.
