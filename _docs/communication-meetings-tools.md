Communication - NEEDS UPDATING
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Product Space Unconference](unconference.html) ocne per year
-   Regular members measure (we need a new name for this) where we catch up to share, support and learn from each other
-   [Board meetings](board-of-directors.html) every month
-   [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for general chat stuff

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums.

Where we **store info**:

-   Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days. Our main doc is the [dashboard](dashboard.html)
-   GitHub - a github organization account for shared code and, well, the Product Space DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   Our website - [www.Product Space.se](http://www.Product Space.se)
-   Our blog - [blog.Product Space.se](http://blog.Product Space.se)
-   A mailing list for our customers and course participants, we send information about upcoming courses about once or twice per quarter.
-   ... but the biggest channel of communication is of course the personal and informal channels - Product Space agents tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and customers. Together we have a huge network!
