Communication - NEEDS UPDATING
=============

Our **main internal communication channels** are:

-   [Product Space Unconference](unconference.html) once per year.
-   Regular Peons where we catch up to share, support and learn from each other (Peons? Yeah, sorry, we invented that word).
-   [Board meetings](board-of-directors.html) every quarter.
-   [Slack](http://www.slack.com) for general stuff, chatting, buns, sharing and asking for help. 

Most decisions are made, and most problems solved, in one of the above forums. Importantly, key decisions are recorded in our Decision log. 

Where we **store info**:

-   Google Docs - we used it for almost everything now a days. Our main doc is the [dashboard](dashboard.html) which includes our Decision log.
- Trello - we've got a board for clients and a board for general company stuff.
-   GitHub - a github account for the Product Space DNA that you are reading right now.

How we **communicate with the outside world**:

-   Our website - [www.theproductspace.com.](http://www.theproductspace.com)
-   Our [blog.](http://www.theproductspace.com/blog/)
-   Slack channels for our clients, course participants and ourselves.
-   But the biggest channel of communication are the  personal and informal channels - Product Space agents tweeting, blogging, and talking to friends and clients.
