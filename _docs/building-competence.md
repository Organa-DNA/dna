Building competence
===================

As shown in [Why this works](why-this-works.html), competence is crucial! If we don't keep building competence, our model will probably stop working.

Fortunately, Product Space is built around individuals who love learning anyway, so it's really just a matter of making sure nothing gets in the way. So we don't have training budgets and approval processes and things like that, we just trust people to manage their own money and take responsibility for their own competence development. 

Having said that, if decent buffer builds up in the entity, it gets shared back to Members through learning and dev, training, coming together. 

Here are some things we do to keep learning:

-   Our yearly [unconference](unconference.html).
-   Members meetup where someone presents something interesting that they've learned or are practicing.
-   Invite our favorite gurus and rock stars to come to Sydney and teach courses or co-train with us.
-   Peer-coaching workshops, where the Memmbers meet to help each other solve problems
-   Write [articles.](https://www.theproductspace.com)
-   Create and teach [courses](https://www.theproductspace.com) (gives the teacher a very strong motivation to learn the topic!)
-   Pair-coach and pair-teach - lets us steal tricks from each other.
-   Share all course material with each other (Google Drive.)

Some of these forums are very active and some less so, it varies over time. But it adds up to a lot of opportunity to learn and that's the key thing. 

At the end of the day, though, it's up to each consultant to reserve the time needed to learn new stuff, and not always be 100% booked up with work.
