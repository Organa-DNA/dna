Member Services Agreement
===================

Each Member runs their own company or sole trader (the language in Australia), and each Member provides services to Product Space. That includes Sarah and Sandy the current owners of the business.

That means that each of us commits to the same Services Agreement and the same conditions.

We put effort into writing our legal agreements in Plain English and dramatically shortening them, for one main reason: **trust**. 

We believe:

- People are systematically and fundamentally good and will do the right thing.
-  As partners, collaborators, guides, coaches and mentors, trust is our default means of engagement. 

We've all read Agreements that go on for pages and pages, where you have to keep looking up the Definitions in order to understand the damn thing. 
 
 Well we hate that so we got our good mate Mark who's a savvy, practica and pragmatic lawyer who understands our values and principles to write something that would achieve our necessary legal requirements but be a fair and reasonable artifact to consume and commit to. 
 
 We gave that copy to Lynne our good mate who specialises in Plain English writing and she finessed it.
 
 The result ... an Agreement we actually enjoy reading. Ok, that's a stretch, but it's an  Agreement that Members can understand quickly and don't need to get legal advice on.
 
 For those in Australia and possibly New Zealand, take a copy and use it for your own work. 
 
 "Thank you". 
 
 It's our pleasure :)
