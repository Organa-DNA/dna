Purpose
=======

One big aha in our evolution was when we realised that Product Space is just a platform. We talked about using words like Community, Platform, Home because all three words describe what we want and we've settled on Home ... why? NBecause it just feels right :)

We have one clear purpose and that is for Product Space to be a [happy home for our Members](what-is-crisp.html).

Like Crisp, we measure this using a Happiness Index which you can take a look at here. 

We have other goals year on year, but this is our key goal and so it comes with a metric.
