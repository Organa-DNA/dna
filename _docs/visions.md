Purpose
=======

One big aha in our evolution was when we realised that Product Space is just a Home. We talked about using words like Community or Platform but we've settled on Home. Why? Because it just feels right :)

We have one clear purpose and that is for Product Space to be a [happy home for our Members](what-is-crisp.html).

Like Crisp, we measure this using a [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) which you can take a look at. 

We have other goals year on year, but this is our key goal and so it comes with a metric.
