Conflict handling
=================

Conflict is inevitable in any organisation because, well, we're all human and from time to time, fragile, sensitive; ocasionally stupid :)

The way we deal with conflict is super important - some conflicts are healthy and productive and drive improvement - other conflicts are shitty, political and suck the soul out of the culture. We want more of the former and less of the latter!

Conflict handling gets a bit tricky with organisations like Product Space, with everything bottom-up, with no management or managers, no place to "escalate". 

Inspired by the book [Reinventing Organizations](http://www.reinventingorganizations.com), we've learned that self-organisation at scale benefits from an explicit conflict handling strategy, a simple process that everyone needs to understand and commit to.

We agreed on this 3-step conflict escalation process:

Our conflict handling process
---------------------------------------------------

**Step 1:** I take responsibility for bringing up and sorting an issue with the involved person(s) ASAP, or accept it and let it go for real (seriously ... you really let it go). If someone brings up an issue with me, I commit to meeting up.

In this phase the two people sit together and try to sort it out privately. The initiator has to make a clear request (not a judgement, not a demand), an the other person has to respond clearly to the request (with a yes, no or perhaps a counterproposal.)

*... if the conflict didn't get solved:*

**Step 2:** Invite a facilitator/mediator that both parties trust. The facilitator's role is to help the parties find a mutually acceptable solution, not try to force his/her own solution upon the conflicting parties.

*... if the conflict didn't get solved:*

**Step 3:** Sev 1 at Product Space with the involved parties.

There's nothing worse than stuff that festers so this is treated with extraordinary priority. A panel of 3 is convened asap; their role to listen an help shape agreement. The panel cannot force a decision but usually carries enough moral weight for matters to come to a conclusion. 

There's no need yet for a Step 4 ...
