How we do sales
===============

Product Space Members mostly sell themselves, and each other. Our sales have been reactive to date but we may move into being more proactive if we need. 

We don't have a sales department and we require each Member to handle their own work opportunities and work load.

Having said that, we do share. That's part of being connected to the Home. 

As a consultant or contractor, timing is a huge challenge. When will my next gig start, will want one or multiple gigs at the same time. How likely is it that a future client will come knocking on the door precisely when I'm done with my current client, etc etc. Most of us who have experienced life as a consultant know we tend to have too much work or too little work, never just enough :0

The solution is *load balancing* - having a group of trusted Members that you can send clients to and receive clients from. And that's exactly what Product Space is - a bunch of trusted Members!

The [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) is our main tool for routing client requests between each other. It helps connect the right client with the right consultant at the right time, which benefits everyone! And it works pretty OK without any kind of central control :)

How do we handle conflicts, such as two Members competing for the same client gig?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the [bun protocol](bun-protocol.html) page for answers to questions about how we route work opportunities internally.

Do we have a "finders fee" for finding gigs for each other?
------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah, nah (that's an Australian saying!). And it means no :)

If you pass a client on to another Member, you won't earn a commission, finder's fee or anything like that. Why? Because the underlying [purpose of Product Space](what-is-productspace.html) is not to maximise profit, it's to maximise [happiness](happiness-index.html). We earn money from our clients, not from each other.

We've found that monetary incentive schemes invite sub-optimisation. People tend to focus on whatever gives them a bigger bonus, instead of what truly benefits the Home. 

Monetary incentives are often pitched as a way to motivate people to work smart and improve, but we find that transparency and feedback are simpler and better. Gross incentives like the above, are one of the many modern day management techniques that we have chucked out because we reckon they don't work anymore.
