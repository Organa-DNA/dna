How Product Space works
===============

We spose some will call this a strategy but it's really about how we operate:

![Product Space Strategy](../assets/theproductspace-how.png "Product Space Strategy")

It hangs on the wall next to the [What is Product Space](what-is-crisp.html). 

What do we measure?
-------------------

We measure:

-   How happy we are (see [Happiness Index](happiness-index.html))
-   How happy our clients are (actually, this point is partly aspirational, we currently measure our clients happiness qualitatively).

How do we finance the home?
---------------------------

To cover our costs, every Member pays a fixed fee per month + % fee of their revenue. The fixed fee is usually around $200/mth, and the variable fee is usually around 8-12%. The fee is intended only to cover Product Space's costs, so we adjust it every quarter based on how much money we have in our coffers. If we have less than our desired liquidity buffer then we raise the fees, and vice versa.

> **Why a fixed + variable fee?** All of our Members have fixed and variable costs. Same with Product Space. With a fixed + variable fee, we get a nice balance that matches the fact that our costs are also fixed + variable. Our Members feel this is a balanced approach.

We also have a ceiling, to limit the total fee a consultant pays to Product Space per year (variable + fixed). Some consultants earn a lot more than others and we don't want them to leave just because Product Space gets too expensive. The ceiling is usually around $20,000 per year.

See [Economic model](economic-model.html) for concrete examples.

What do we do with the money?
-----------------------------

The guiding principles are:

-   **Naked in, Naked out / Gold in, Gold out** - you don't need to put in serious cash to join Product Space, and there's nothing to cash out when you leave.
-   **No gold on the table** - we don't try to build financial value in the company.
-   **No pot of gold at that end** - there's no financial incentive to sell the company.
-   **A gold-strewn road** - you keep most of what you earn, as you earn it.
-   **Continual improvement** - where we can, and if the buffer builds up, we spend it on group activities; learning, coming together, fun.

> **Why don't we try to build financial value?** If Product Space has a big pile of money, that creates a financial incentive to own the company, and increases the risk of conflict as the "value" of the company goes up and down. If we keep the company lean, with only a small liquidity buffer, then we don't need to argue about who owns what.

See [Economic model](economic-model.html) and [Ownership model](ownership-model.html) for more details on how money flows through the system.

How many do we want to be?
--------------------------

-   We don't have a growth target. Growth is not a goal in itself.
-   We grow only when we find amazing people.

For more see [Recruiting](recruiting.html).

How do we run the company?
--------------------------

-   **Lean & Agile** - our approach is based on lean and [agile](http://agilemanifesto.org) principles.
-   **Meritocracy & Consensus** - we don't have titles, managers, or reporting structures. Instead we are a [meritocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy), which basically means your power to influence stuff is based on your competence and engagement. Decisions are made mostly using consensus ([here's how](decisions.html)).
-   **Don't ask for permission** - if you want to start or change something, go ahead! The default answer to any request or idea is "Sure! If you believe in it and want to put time into it". Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so we encourage each other to just try things rather than seek permission.
-   **Simple models** - we can come up with detailed rules and structures for any kind problem. But we really try not to. We don't want to overcomplicate things, and prefer to err on the side of simplicity. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high level guiding principles than low level detailed procedures.

For more info, see [How we make decisions](decisions.html).

How do we differentiate?
------------------------

How are we different from a typical consulting company?

-   Product Space doesn't want to earn money from its consultants
-   100% freedom for all consultants (as long as they don't hurt the home)
-   Product Space has no other goal than to provide a happy home.

How are we different from a typical network of independents?

-   We are dedicated to Product Space - that is, consultants are expected to do all their work and invoicing through Product Space.
-   We commit to helping and supporting each other.
