What is Organa and why?
======================

Our purpose is simple: to enable our Members to be happy. We measure only one thing and that's their happiness. 

We've visualised "Our home" below, along with a description of other things that are important to us.

We bring it to our gatherings and meetups to remind us of who we are and why, and also in case we want to update it.  

## What we do

We are an agile product management business. We  coach individuals, teams and leaders in product management and new ways of working. We love seeing human potential unleashed and valuable products created for customers when you work with a team to craft new approaches to the work they do.

We touch all parts of the product lifecycle but have a preference and love for work around product discovery, UX and team makeup. Agile is our approach. 

In simple terms, we are a consultancy. But a consultancy done differently. Very differently. 


## What we value

Organa is a home for consultants (Members) specialising in people and team coaching, product management and UX, who value:

-   **Trust** - as partners, guides, coaches or collaborators, trust is is our default means of engagement.
-   **Heart** - we are kind and help those around us: inside and outside the organisation. 
-   **Freedom** - to manage our own time and who we work with. We have autonomy to determine who we are and make our own informed choices. 
-   **Creative Thinking** - working with unknowns requires openness, curiosity and creativity.
-   **Competence** - continually learning and improving, both our craft and who we are as people.
-   **Balance** - we believe in the power of collective intelligence.


We reckon these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Because of how important they are to us, we've banged on a bit more about them below. 

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).


> If you [clone the Organa model](how-to-copy.html), you don't have to have the same values. You may have ones that are special to you so use them. Our model derives from our core values which are close to those shared by Crisp so the closer your values are to ours or Crips's, the better the model will fit your context.

## More on our values

Trust
 - People fundamentally want and will do the right thing.
- People are systematically considered to be good.

Heart
- Organa is a living thing: it’s organic in nature and it has a heart.
- Vulnerability, humility and honesty are just fine: we don’t know everything.

Freedom
- Personal independence along with self-determination enables us to lead rich lives.
- With freedom and autonomy assumed, accountability and transparency are received. Said another way, freedom and accountability are two sides of the same coin.

Creative Thinking
- Great ideas come from anywhere so we see and encourage the potential in others.
- People have imaginations and they will use them, again and again (and again).

Competence
- Continuous learning and improvement is essential for our craft.
- Honing and practising our craft is critical.

Balance
- Everything is shareable: knowledge, power, wealth, information. And kindness.
- Things should be balanced: in financial reward, in flatter organisational structures, in how power is used and distributed, in sharing information and knowledge. And importantly in our personal lives. We could go on and on about this but you get the point right :)
