Acknowledgement
=============================

What's described on the following pages are values we’ve held for a long-time, they just didn’t have anywhere to channel or be expressed until Organa came along.

What we found when we sat down to articulate and express who we are, how we want to work, how we want to be, and how we want our company to be, we realised there are others out there who feel the same way we do. 

Spending time with our mates [Nomad8](https://www.noamd8.com) in New Zealand, we realised they run the way we want to. We've had lots of drinks and dinners with these folk and they've been super helpful. We also learned that they learned off their friends, [Crisp](https://www.crisp.se), in Sweden. 

When we poured over the Crisp website we came across their DNA, a detailed expression of who they are. And they encourage others who are interested, to copy their content from Github. So we did :) 

Whilst much of it has been morphed into our language, Crisp have done the heavy work to document it.

So we'd like to thank them both from deep within our hearts because a lot of what we say here, is what they say and think too.

Thank you [Nomad8](https://www.nomad8.com) and thank you [Crisp](https://www.crisp.se).
