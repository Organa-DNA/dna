Office team - DELETE THIS
===========

We have an office team of 2 full-time employees that are based in our office in Stockholm, plus some extra staff that are pulled in when needed. The office team does most of the non-consulting work needed to run the day to day operations.

Things like:

-   Client invoicing and payment followup.
-   Course and event administration (setting up registration pages, handling customer inquiries, sending emails, etc).
-   Office management (making sure new people have keys, organizing cleaning, ordering books, buy furniture and course materials, etc).
-   Organize the bi-annual [Crisp unconference](unconference.html).

These are just a few examples, not a complete list. The office team does *a lot* of stuff!

Who is the line manager of the office staff?
--------------------------------------------

The office team members are actual employees, so someone needs to set salaries. At Crisp the office team members do this themselves! The employees are self-managed.

When the team members need someone to talk to or use as a sounding board they each have a buddy. The team members select their own buddies (a person who they trust and who is happy to take on that role).

What about sales?
-----------------

The office team doesn't really do sales, although they indirectly support the sales process (for example by routing client requests, as per the [Bun Protocol](bun-protocol.html)). Sales is done mostly by the consultants themselves, and by our business developer. See [Sales](sales.html).
