Courses
================

Although we are at heart a consulting company, we do offer courses and workshops. So how does that work with our model?

How we do courses
-----------------

Product Space itself doesn't really run courses, it just provides the platform.

Anyone at Product Space can organise a course (or an event or workshop), and when they do so they implicitly take on the Producer role for that course.

Driving principles:

-   Each course or event has a Producer.
-   As Producer, you "own" the course. You are responsible for the course as whole, including course design, quality, marketing, etc.
-   As Producer, you own the financial result of your course (win or loss). Just like with consulting, Product Space retains X% of your profit (see [economic model](economic-model.html)).
-   Product Space's role is to be the "platform", providing things such as a classroom and admin support (invoices, lunch reservation, email comms, registration page, etc).
-   Product Space charges the Producer a reasonable and fair fixed admin fee that covers the cost of the office and admin support.

The Producer doesn't necessarily have to teach the course (although that's the most common case). Sometimes a Producer will invite a "star" (someone outside of Product Space who is a well-known "guru" within his/her field) and host or co-teach a course with another Product Space Member.

Example
-------

Here's a high-level summary of what happens with a typical course:

1.  Sarah decides to teach an Agile Foundations course.
2.  Sarah opens the Product Space calendar on Google, finds an open slot Feb 12-13, and writes Agile Foundations course (Sarah)". 
3.  Sarah asks the Product Space office team to set up a registration page. She's taught this course before, so she can copy-paste from the last course instance.
4.  Sarah synchronises with other producers to make sure her course is mentioned in the next marketing email (see next section below).
5.  Registrations start coming in and course registrations automatically end up in Google Spreadsheet.
6.  About a week before the course, Sarah sends a welcome email to the course participants.
7.  Feb 12 arrives. Sarah shows up at Product Space. Breakfast is served, handouts printed, everything ready to go.
8.  This is also the day when invoices get sent to  participants. 
9.  At the end of the course, Sarah asks people to fill in a course feedback sheet. She notes some improvement ideas, calculates the Net Promoter Score, and adds a row to our shared Course Log (see Quality below).
10. Sarah sends an email to all course participants with a link to course materials and such. They also add the course participants to our mailing list for future event notifications (they can of course opt out at any time).
11. Sarah figures out the course profit and sends an invoice to Product Space (minus the [Product Space tax](economic-model.html), just like with any consulting).

Quality and customer feedback
-----------------------------

We are pretty systemic when it comes to course quality. For every course, the Producer is expected to measure [Net Promoter Score](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) (NPS) and post it on the Course Log (a shared spreadsheet listing all courses and basic data such as who produced it, how many participants showed up, NPS, etc).

The purpose of the course log is to provide internal transparency, so we can learn from each other's successes and failures. It's not mandatory (very few things are), but we encourage each other to fill it in.

Marketing
---------

Typically one of the producers of an upcoming course will take lead on this, talk to other producers, agree on what should be done (usually via a shared Google Doc). They will of course also market the courses through their personal networks, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and whatever other channels make sense. If a course needs an extra push they might ask other Product Spaceers to retweet, etc.

What if people don't sign up?
-----------------------------

Together we have a really big network so most courses at least break even. In some cases, however, the registrations just don't come in, and if it's really bad we have to cancel.

Fortunately, Product Space doesn't charge the Producer for a course if it got canceled. It's like a small insurance (or failure cushion). As a result, the cost of canceling a course is quite low for the producer (except for damaged pride). Why? Because we *want* people to experiment with new types of courses, since that benefits everyone in the long run. Make innovation easier by minimising the cost of failure!

### Fake it till you make it

A few Product Spaceers puts up registrations for courses for which no course material exists. If no one signs up, then no one is harmed. If enough people sign-up, then there can be a mad scramble to create the course the few weeks before the course. This may not sound like a serious way to run things, but in a way it is like a lean startup - make a minimal product and see if it flies. And regardless of how professional a course may seem, the first time it was held the teachers were out on a limb and very nervous about it.

This model works as long as nobody gets too reckless! Too many canceled courses would hurt the Product Space brand (see [how we build the brand](brand-building.html)). So far that hasn't been a problem.
