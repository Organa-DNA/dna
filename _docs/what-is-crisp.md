What is Product Space and why?
======================

Our purpose is simple: to enable our Members to be happy. We measure only one thing and that's their happiness. 

We refer to this as "our home" which we've visualsed below, along with a description of other things  that are important to us. 

[insert our home]

It hangs on the wall in our office, and we bring it to our gatherings and meetups to reminds us of who we are and why and also in case we want to update it.  

In simple terms, we are a consultancy. But a consultancy done differently. Very differently. We consult in product management and all its flavours. 

## What we value

Product Space is a home for consultants (Members) specialising in digital product management or an important relative to it such as agile or UX, who value:

-   **Trust** - As partners, guides, coaches or collaborators, trust is is our default means of engagement.
-   **Heart** - We are kind and help those around us: inside and outside the organisation. 
-   **Freedom** - To manage our own time and who we work with, and autonomoy to be who we are and make our own informed choices. 
-   **Creative Thinking** - Working with unknowns requires openness, curiosity and creativity.
-   **Competence** - Continually learning and improving, both our craft and who we are as people.
-   **Balance** - We believe in the power of collective intelligence.

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Because of how important they are to us, we've banged on a bit more about them below. 

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).


> If you [clone the Product Space model](how-to-copy.html), you don't have to have the same values. You may have ones that are special to you so use them. Our model derives from our core values which are close to those shared by Crisp so the closer your values are to ours or Crips's, the better the model will fit your context.

## More on our values

Trust
 - People fundamentally want to do the right thing.
- People are systematically considered to be good.

Heart
- Product Space is a living thing: it’s organic in nature and it has a heart.
- Vulnerability, humility and honesty are just fine: we don’t know everything.

Freedom
- Personal independence along with self-determination allows us to lead rich lives 
- With freedom and autonomy given, accountability and transparency gets received. Said another way, freedom and accountability are two sides of the same coin.

Creative Thinking
- Great ideas come from anywhere so we see and encourage the potential in others.
- People have imaginations and they will use them, again and again (and again).

Competence
- Continuous learning and improvement is essential for our craft.
- Honing and practicing our craft is critical.

Balance
- Everything is shareable: knowledge, power, wealth, information.
- Things should be balanced: in financial reward, in flatter organisational structures, in how power is used and distributed, in sharing information and knowledge. And importantly in our personal lives. We could go on and on about this but you get the point right :)
