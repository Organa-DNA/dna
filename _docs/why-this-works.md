Why this model works (for us)
=============================

The model below is something we learned from the folk at Crisp and having reflected upon it, we realise it suits us perfectly. It's how we've been working for a while now, we just hadn't visualised it. We've modified our version from the Crisp original, to suit us, but it is essentially, how they've articulated their formula. 

We're new compared to Crisp, so as we do more good work, we can look back on it against the backdrop of our real world experience and reflect on how it's working.

The key thing is the two loops - positive feedback cycles that keep getting stronger and stronger.

Positive feedback loops
-----------------------

**Left loop:**

1. Competent & motivated Members do a better job, which leads to happy clients.
2. Happy clients give us a good reputation.
3. Good reputation increases our motivation further & attracts competent people to Product Space.
4. GOTO 1

**Right loop:**

1. Competent & motivated Members do a better job, which leads to happy customers.
2. More and happier customers leads to higher profit.
3. Higher profit means people can afford to spend time learning new things (instead of trying to make every hour billable), and feel more safe doing so.
4. Taking time to learn, explore and improve together makes us more motivated and more competent.
5. GOTO 1

Measure and manage motivation. Profit is a side effect.
------------------------------------------------------------

The key point is that we focus on keeping ourselves and our clients happy; we don't focus on profit or growth. Good reputation and profit are simply side effects of keeping ourselves and our clients happy.

Hire amazing people, or don't hire at all
-----------------------------------------

Recruitment is crucial - the model only works as long as we are super-picky about who we bring in. If we start getting below-par Members, the positive loops above could easily turn into negative loops (bad Members =&gt; disappointed clients =&gt; bad reputation =&gt; the best Members leave =&gt; etc).

This makes for a slow-growth model but we're really very OK with that. Because we want to work with experienced and amazig people who share our values, recruitment is thus slow. 

See [Recruiting](recruiting.html) for more details on this.
