What is this?
=============

This site is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) site describing how Product Space works and why. Think of it as our DNA, or our manifesto.

The way we work and why is so important to us that we want to describe it in detail. In the process of doing this, we discovered Crisp, an extraordinary company in Sweden. The content you read here comes largely from Crisp documenting the way they work, and why. Crisp allows organisations to clone a copy of their DNA for re-use. And we've done that. From deep in our hearts, thank you [Crisp](https://www.crisp.se).

We have modified quite a bit of it to suit us and our Australian way of doing things, but in essence, we think and act the same as Crisp.

[Product Space](https://www.theproductspace.com) is a agile product management consulting company based in Sydney, Australia. We are a consulting company but importantly, we do consulting differently
For example:

-   Firstly we hate the word consultants so we call ourselves Members. Having said that, consulting is an obvious description of what we do.
- None of the Members are employed by Product Space.
-   We have no managers, no admin, not even a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organisation and transparency. Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
-   Product Space's main purpose is to enable consultants to be happy, and the [Product Space Happiness Index](happiness-index.html) is our driving metric. Strong revenue and delighted clients are a side effect, not a goal.
-   Product Space doesn't earn money from it's Members. It is in practice, a non-profit company (although not formally so). Members [keep most of what they earn](economic-model.html). Gold in, gold out for those that work at Produt Space.
-   Our [ownership model](ownership-model.html) is designed to keep our stock financially worthless. There is no incentive to "cash in". The company isn't worth anything, financially speaking. 
-   Members are 100% autonomous. They can do whatever they want (as long as they don't hurt the brand or [our Home](what-is-crisp.html)), and work as much or as little as they want, for who they want.

People are quite intrigued when we talk about this and are curious as to how it works in practice, especially from other consultants looking to create something similar. 

Between what we've learned from Crisp and our amazing friends at Nomad8 in New Zealand, we've converged on a model that works well, basically the sweet spot between being an independent consultant and being an employee.
